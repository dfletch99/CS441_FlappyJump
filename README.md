# CS441_FlappyJump
You can probably tell from the title alone what this is.

# Gameplay
Title screen has a cute animation of a bird flapping about. Tap anywhere on the screen to start playing (after an animation or two and a 
countdown).
Bird will fall down unless the screen is tapped. Tap the screen to pop up a bit. Walls come in from the right-hand side of the screen with 
a gap in a random location. Hit the wall or the ground and the game is over. +1 score for each gap passed through.
When the game is over, the bird rises into the air. This is to symbolize its soul going to heaven, just like mine wants to this finals 
week.

# Struggles
I tried to send scores to the web, but much like the problem with leaderboard implementation from assignment 4, libGdx seems to have a massive problem with being its own android activity. I'm not really sure what's going on here, but either way, there was nothing I could do or think of to do to get this to work.
